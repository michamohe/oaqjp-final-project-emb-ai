# AI-Powered Emotion Detection Web Application

A Python and Flask-based web application that analyzes the emotional tone of user-provided text using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The application detects five core emotions—anger, disgust, fear, joy, and sadness—and identifies the dominant emotion.

This project was developed as part of the **IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate** and extended for portfolio presentation and future integration into a modular AI tool stack.
